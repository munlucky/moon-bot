# Output and Format

- If the user specifies a format, follow it with highest priority.
- Otherwise, use headings/lists only when it improves readability.
- Code/commands are fenced code blocks or backticks.
- For long markdown outputs (plans/reviews/improvements), avoid oversized single responses: split into multiple files (e.g., `*-part-1.md`, `*-part-2.md`) or archive full logs and keep only a short summary in the main file to prevent output token overflow.
